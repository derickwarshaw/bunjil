# Bunjil

Bunjil is a public facing GraphQL library/server.

Itâ€™s purpose is to allow the stitching of one or more private GraphQL Schemas into a public one.

It allows you to overwrite `Types` to hide fields, overwrite resolvers, add more resolvers.

It runs an Authentication and Authorization callback before processing any `GraphQL` request.

## Getting Started

Documentation coming real soon.
